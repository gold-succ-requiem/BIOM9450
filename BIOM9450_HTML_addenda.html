Intro
- focus of this year's conference

This year, two plenary workshops on ICD-10-AM and HL7 will take place. All attendants are strongly encouraged to attend, as it will serve as an opportunity to strengthen knowledge about existing and future standards for health messaging and disease coding. Lunch will be served.

ICD-10-AM
- ICD-10 by WHO: what is it, what does it do, deficiencies
- aussie mod: y tho
- future ICD: ICD-11, updating our systems
- further reading (i.e. references)

ICD-10 is the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases. Developed by the World Health Organization, ICD-10 aims to systematically define and unify disease codes on an international level. ICD-10 allows medical professionals, researchers, and policy-makers to communicate across the globe under a common medical language.

ICD-10-AM modifies ICD-10 standards for Australia's unique healthcare landscape. ICD-10-AM allows for ease of use by Australian medical professionals by complementing international standards set by the WHO with existing local standards. Importantly, coding for procedures is integrated into ICD-10-AM based on the Commonwealth Medical Benefits Schedule.

In 2018, the WHO published the most recent revision of the ICD, ICD-11, to ensure the ICD corroborates with contemporary medical advances. In particular, whereas previous ICD standards have often been accompanied with country-specific modifications, ICD-11 aims to mitigate this by hard-coding tools for regional modification within the international ICD-11 standards. Moving forward, the Australian healthcare system nonetheless faces challenges in adapting the revised ICD such that it remains relevant to Australian healthcare requirements and data.

HL7
- what is it, what does it do?
- deficiencies
- future modifications
- further reading (i.e. references)

HL7 comprises standards, produced and maintained by HL7 International, which aim to improve interoperability between the variety of information and messaging systems used by healthcare organisations. Efficient electronic messaging is key to streamlining medical interactions at all levels, including consultation, diagnostics, procedures, and even administration. 

Internationally, HL7 is comprised of various standards dealing with different applications, including transactions, document exchange, and medical supply dispensing. In particular, the primary standards are most widely used. HL7 Australia is the Australian affiliate of HL7 International, and adapts HL7 standards for Australian healthcare communication requirements.

HL7 Version 2 is currently the most widespread implementation of HL7 standards, including Australia. Notably, Australian Pathology Messaging standards; and Australian Diagnostics and Referral Messaging standards are all localisations of HL7 Standard 2.4. 

HL7 Version 3 messaging is intended as a "next generation" implementation of HL7 messaging. In particular, Clinical Document Architecture applies HL7 v3 standards to representing e-health documents. My Health Record, a recent government initiative to summarise Australians' medical information online, is based on HL7 CDA.

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a developing implementation of HL7 standards. FHIR is oriented around manipulating discrete data elements rather than whole documents. As such, FHIR potentially offers improved granularity in comparison previous HL7 standards, in terms of treating records as sets of independent yet related data objects. Moreover, FHIR also aims to be more user-friendly, providing human-readable records. Australia has yet to widely adopt FHIR, and adapting FHIR in existing Australian health information systems is a key element of this year's conference.
